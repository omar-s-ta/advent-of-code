# Advent Of Code

A collection of my solutions for Advent of Code, organized by year.
This repository serves as a long-term archive to track progress, experiment
with different problem-solving approaches, and revisit past challenges.

Each year has its own directory, containing solutions, notes, and any helper
utilities used along the way.
The goal is consistency, learning, and steady improvement—one December at a time.
